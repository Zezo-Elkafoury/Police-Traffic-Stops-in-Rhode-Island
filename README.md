# Police Traffic Stops Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Police Traffic Stops Data Analysis Project! This project aims to provide insights into law enforcement practices through the analysis of a dataset containing information on police traffic stops.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from [insert source name/link], and it includes detailed records of police traffic stops. The dataset comprises information such as stop date/time, driver demographics, violation details, and stop outcomes.

## Tools and Libraries
The analysis was conducted using Python programming language along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Structure
- `police.csv`: Raw dataset file.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
- Other files: Any additional resources or files used in the project.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Data Cleaning:** Irrelevant columns were removed, missing values were handled, and data types were converted for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various aspects of the dataset were explored, including the distribution of violation types, gender disparities in traffic violations, arrest rates, and correlation between traffic stops and drug-related activities.
- **Insights:** The analysis uncovered significant insights into law enforcement practices, including potential disparities in enforcement actions based on demographic factors.

## How to Use
